# Timur
An object oriented toy programmin language

## How to test
Install cmake and bison if you don't have them

Clone the repository and run this
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
For now we only have lexer and parser (which only recognises 'var' keyword ðŸ¤¨)

So this will build them and run with test.tmr as input source code

You can change test.tmr it and `./run.sh` again
###### You can change anything you want actually...
