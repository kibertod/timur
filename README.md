# Timur
An object oriented toy programmin language

## How to test
Install cmake and bison if you don't have them

Clone the repository and run this
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
###### Idk if this will work on windows ☠️
For now we only have lexer and parser

So this will build them, run with test.tmr as input source code and output an AST

You can change test.tmr it and `./run.sh` again
###### You can change anything you want actually...
